            Violation of law by a child is called Juvenile Delinquency. Delinquency is an antisocial and criminal behaviour committed by a person who is under the age of 18; that is, who is not an adult. Juvenile delinquency is also called delinquency. When a person reaches adulthood, antisocial and criminal behaviour done by him can be said as a crime. Thus, we can say that juvenile delinquency is the child and adolescent version of the crime.

            <h3>1. Status Offense</h3>
            <p>Status offenses are not considered to be good for children and adolescents. Because of the age of the offender, these behaviours are proscribed. If these offenses are committed by adults, behaviours are not illegal. Drinking or possessing alcohol, consuming tobacco, running away from home, truancy or not attending school without any good reason, and violating curfew are examples of status offenses.</p>
            <h4>2. Deliquent Offense</h4>
            <p>Delinquent offenses violate the legal statutes that also apply to adults in the criminal justice system. Acts of violence are included under delinquent offenses such as murder, rape, armed robbery, aggravated and simple assault, harassment, stalking, menacing, child abuse, and other similar offenses. Delinquent offenses include acts that are concerned with property crimes, such as burglary, theft or larceny, motor vehicle theft arson, damage to property, criminal mischief, vandalism, and others.</p>
